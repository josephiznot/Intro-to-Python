#  Welcome to Python!

#####################
#######_Intro_#######
#####################
#  The 'print' method, prints the output to the screen.

#  Step: Print 'Hello world' to the screen. 

#  Step: Comment out the line above line of code.

#####################
#####_Variables_#####
#####################
#  Variables store data for values. They can be of many types, such as
#  a string, a number, a boolean(True, False), or even a calulation.

#  Step: Create a variable for your first name and last name.

#  Step: Create a few more variables describing characteristics of yourself.

#  The print method can print multiple values outputs at once.
#  Step: Print the characteristics from above:

#  Variables can even store results for arithmetic problems.
#  Step: Calculate the dog's age in dog years and store it in a variable.
#          Hint: 1 year = 7 dog years.
dogs_age = 1

#####################
#######_Lists_#######
#####################
#  A list is an indexed pair of values starting with 0.
#  Its values are denoted in square brackets e.g. ['value1', 'value2']

#  Step: Create a list of 5 video games and assign it to a variable.

#  You can access a value in a list by using bracket notation with its index.
#  Example:
#  friends = ['Sam', 'John', 'Liz']
#  print(friends[0])
#  >>'Liz'

#  Step:  Print the 3rd game in the list of games.

#  You can change values by simply assigning it again..
#  E.g. friends[0] = 'Bill'

#  Step: Change a video game's name in the list and then print the entire list.

#####################
#####_Functions_#####
#####################
#  Step: Calculate the volume of a figure for given dimensions:
#        width = 4
#        height = 4
#        length = 12

#  Step: Do it again, but with these dimensions:
#        width = 2
#        height = 3
#        length = 5

#  Step: Create a function that calculates the volume of a figure and then print the result.

##########################
###Comparison Operators###
##########################
#  Python allows you to compare two values using comparision operators
#  such as '==', '!=', '<', '>', '>=', '<='. Conditions will evaluate to either True or False.

#  Step: Calculate the volumes of two figures and then compare them.
#        Print the conditional statement.

#####################
########_IF_#########
#####################
#  The 'if' statement is a boolean expression that executes a block
#  of code if the conditional statement evaluates to True. 

#  Step: If the two figures do not equal each other from above,
#        print 'Not equal to each other.' to the console.

#  The 'else' statement comes after the 'if' statement, and will execute
#  when the previous conditions fail. Think of it like the catch-all statement.

#  Step: If the two figures do each other, print 'Equal to each other.'
